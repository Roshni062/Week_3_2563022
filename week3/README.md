# User Defined Package for Arithmetic Operations (Java)

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of **user-defined packages in Java** to perform basic arithmetic operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.  
Each operation is implemented in a separate class inside a custom package named `arithmetic`.

## Package Structure

Week3
│
├── arithmetic
│ ├── Addition.java
│ ├── Subtraction.java
│ ├── Multiplication.java
│ └── Division.java
│
└── MainApp.java


## Features
- Demonstrates creation of user-defined packages
- Modular and reusable code
- Uses OOP concepts
- Input taken from the user
- Handles division by zero safely

## Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 8+)
- Command Line / IDE (NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ)


## Exception Handling
The project implements exception handling using:
- ArithmeticException for division by zero
- InputMismatchException for invalid user input
- Generic Exception for unexpected runtime errors

This ensures the program is robust, user-friendly, and follows Advanced Java best practices.
